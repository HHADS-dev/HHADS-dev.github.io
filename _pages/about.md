Hi! I am Yi Liu, a first year Master Student in Electrical and Computer Engineer at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) in the area of [Robotics](https://robotics.umich.edu/). I graduate from the [Glasgow College](https://www.gla.uestc.edu.cn/english/Home.htm) at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and University of Glasgow in 2024.

I am now working as a graduate research assistant at the [Field Robotics Group](https://fieldrobotics.engin.umich.edu/home/) under the guidance of Prof. [Katie Skinner](https://robotics.umich.edu/profile/katherine-skinner/) and [Jingyu Song](https://song-jingyu.github.io/) at the [University of Michigan Robotics Department](https://robotics.umich.edu/).

I am interested in the applications of AI technology such as Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning in the area of Robotics.
